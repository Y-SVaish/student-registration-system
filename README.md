# student-registration-system

Project: Student Registration Portal

Description:
	This project takes in the name, registration number and semester of a student, and allows him/her to pick an open elective or program elective based on their semester. The project is primitive in nature and is divided into two packages: projectJava (two classes) and electives (three classes). The code totally adds to give around 448 lines. It is inspired by a YouTube video.
